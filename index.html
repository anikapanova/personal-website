            I am Anika Panova, I am 19 years old and I am currently a student at the Faculty of Information Sciences and
            Computer Engineering (FINKI). I have focused my academic journey on the field of information science and
            technology, with a particular interest in creative and digital media.<br><br>
            In addition to my studies, I also work in marketing for companies, where I gain experience in content
            creation, digital strategy and branding. This allows me to combine my technical knowledge with creativity
            and communication skills.<br><br>

            I strive for constant personal and professional development, I am open to new challenges and believe in the
            power of technology and design to create positive change. I am always open to new projects, collaborations
            and learning something new.<br><br>
