            <p>
                I am an event organizer, as well as a manager of several projects of Junior Achievement Macedonia and
                Teen Managers, and in 2023 a volunteer at ZOO Skopje.<br><br>
                I participated in trainings and projects, including: Class Marker projects, the project for
                strengthening digital and entrepreneurial skills among women "Girls Go Circular", the "Teen Managers"
                training organized by the Association of Project Managers of Macedonia, the innovation camp organized by
                "Junior Achievement", as well as many other discussions and workshops thanks to which I gained great
                experience, knowledge and skills.
