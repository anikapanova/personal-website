                Some of them are using the C++ programming language, forming the best student company of the year,
                acquiring skills for success, as well as the ability to work in a team.<br><br>
                I fully dedicate myself to the given task. I like to research and quickly find information on a specific
                topic. I analyze data well, I easily find the problem and its solution. I adapt easily. I consider
                myself a team player, but I also work well individually.<br><br>
                I am very good at using: Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Photoshop, HTML and CSS.
